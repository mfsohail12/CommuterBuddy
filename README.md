# CommuterBuddy

**A community-driven platform connecting university students and commuters who share similar routes for a more social and safer travel.**

## Project Overview

By turning idle time into meaningful social interaction, CommuterBuddy fosters personal connections, enhances mental well-being, and encourages a sense of community during your commutes. CommuterBuddy offers a simple solution: by inputting your regular travel routes and times, the app helps you find others who share similar commutes, giving you the chance to strike up conversations, make new friends, or simply pass the time together. Whether you're looking for a friendly face to chat with on your morning bus, someone to vent to about that never-ending group project, or even a potential study buddy who shares your academic interests, CommuterBuddy turns the everyday grind of commuting into an opportunity for connection and support.
