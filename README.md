## Last but not least - Team ðŸ’»:

- I, **[Shihab](https://github.com/shihabhasan0161) â€“ The Map Magician**  
  I led project scaffolding and frontend work, including creating our Leaflet-based map UI, squashing bugs across the app, and implementing Supabase for authentication and database.

- **[Sam](https://github.com/FadedBronze) â€“ The Linux Guy**  
  Engineered our real-time chat and kept the backend shipshape: wrote core socket logic, reviewedâ€”and vanquishedâ€”bugs throughout the codebase.

- **[Muhammad](https://github.com/mfsohail12) â€“ The UX Wizard**  
  Crafted the map-page experience and key UI tweaks: iterated on layouts, sprinkled design magic, and collaborated closely with the whole squad.

- **[Sakshi](https://github.com/sakshixgoel) â€“ The Logo Maestro**  
  Forged the product vision and branding: dreamed up the concept, built the request form, and composed our project logo and style guide.
